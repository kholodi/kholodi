- 👋 Hi, I’m @kholodi
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Data Engineering and Machine Learning algorithms. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a website where users can write their symptoms and receive list of conditions that they may have. Millions around the world are suffering from an undiagnosed medical conditions and doctors just can't figure out what is wrong with them. They run countless tests but still can't figure out the condition. On the backend, I want to web scrape Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and find out people with similar symptoms. Then shortlist conditions the patient has not been tested for previously. We'll call it Dr_House_Diagnostic.ai
